# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app assets like icons, splash screens, and images.

The following files are expected by Expo:
- icon.png (app icon)
- splash.png (splash screen)
- adaptive-icon.png (Android adaptive icon)
- favicon.png (web favicon)

For now, these are placeholders. Replace with actual app assets.
