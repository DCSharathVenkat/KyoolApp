# Backend-Frontend Integration Test Plan

## 🧪 **Testing the Real Database Connection**

### **Test 1: User Authentication & Profile Creation**
1. Open the KyoolApp
2. Sign in with Google
3. **Expected**: 
   - User profile automatically created in backend database
   - Console shows: `✅ New user profile created: your-email@gmail.com`
   - Dashboard loads with your name from Google account

### **Test 2: Profile Update & Weight Logging**
1. Navigate to Profile screen
2. Edit your height, weight, and age
3. Tap "Save"
4. **Expected**:
   - Profile updates in backend database
   - Weight log automatically created
   - Console shows: `✅ Profile saved successfully`

### **Test 3: Dashboard Real Data**
1. Check Dashboard after profile update
2. **Expected**:
   - Shows your real name from Google account
   - Displays your actual email
   - Health metrics reflect saved data

### **Test 4: Sign Out & Sign In**
1. Sign out from Profile screen
2. Sign back in with same Google account
3. **Expected**:
   - Profile data persists
   - Dashboard shows saved information
   - Console shows: `✅ User profile loaded: your-email@gmail.com`

## 🔍 **Backend API Verification**

You can verify the backend integration by checking the console logs:

### **Successful Integration Logs:**
```
🌐 API Request: POST https://kyool-backend-606917950237.us-central1.run.app/auth/me
✅ API Response successful for /auth/me
👤 Authenticated user: your-email@gmail.com
✅ User profile loaded: your-email@gmail.com
```

### **New User Creation Logs:**
```

🌐 API Request: POST https://kyool-backend-606917950237.us-central1.run.app/users/your-uid
✅ API Response successful for /users/your-uid
✅ New user profile created: your-email@gmail.com
```

### **Profile Update Logs:**

✅ API Response successful for /users/your-uid
✅ Weight log added successfully
✅ Profile saved successfully
```

## 🎯 **What's Now Connected:**

✅ **Authentication**: Google Sign-In → Firebase → Backend token verification
✅ **User Profiles**: Automatic creation and sync with Firestore database
✅ **Profile Updates**: Real-time sync between app and backend
✅ **Weight Logging**: Automatic BMI/BMR/TDEE calculations stored in database
✅ **Dashboard Data**: Uses real user profile instead of demo data
✅ **Sign Out**: Proper cleanup and navigation reset

## 🔄 **What's Still Using Demo Data:**

⚠️ **Daily Stats**: Step count, water intake, calories (APIs not implemented yet)
⚠️ **Recipes**: Using mock data (recipe API endpoints exist but not fully integrated)
⚠️ **Fitness**: Using demo workout data (fitness tracking not implemented)
⚠️ **Activity Feed**: Mock friend activities (social features not implemented)

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Full Integration:**

1. **Activity Tracking**: Connect fitness trackers for real step/calorie data
2. **Water Intake**: Add daily water logging to backend
3. **Recipe Integration**: Connect meal logging with backend
4. **Social Features**: Implement friend system with backend
5. **Device Sync**: Connect health device APIs
